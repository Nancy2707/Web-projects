        Both "X" and "O", a pair of players, are needed to play.

        <br />
        <br />
        The playing field consists of a predetermined grid into which players
        will insert their tokens to win control of individual cells.
        <br />
        <br />

        Players take turns going first, with "X" being the norm.
        <br />
        <br />

        The objective is to win by controlling three adjacent cells in a row,
        which might be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
        <br />
        <br />

        The grid cannot expand to accommodate more sides.
        <br />
        <br />

        The game is done when the grid is full, or one player gets three in a
        row.

<br>
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
<br>
<br>
You are X , your friend (or the computer in this case) is O . Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
<br>
<br>
The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
